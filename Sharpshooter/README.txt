I really appreciate you spending your time and effort downloading and using this program. I
spent many hours on this, so I would appreciate if you shared this around! Anyways, onto the
instructions.

To launch, simply open or double click Sharpshooter.exe. You can safely ignore all other files,
but make sure not to delete them. From there, you will be asked whatusername you want to snipe,
what time the cooldown ends, etc.

Note: This is pretty basic, which allows it to snipe fast compared to other snipers. However,
because of this the features are limited. You can't queue up multiple names, snipe
any 3 letter name, etc. If enough people want it, I might even update this eventually.
